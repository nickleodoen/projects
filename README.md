1) my_look.c:

my_look is a simple command-line program that takes either a file or command line data as input, and searches for a specific string in the input. Although this program is exceedingly simple, there are many options which make this program slighly more complex, and there is lots of error handling making the program secure and robust. The program uses 256-byte buffers to handle data, and the comments explain the workflow of the code. 

Option "-V": displays an introduction message

Option "-h": help

Option "-f": specify a file as input right after


2) wordle.c:

worlde is a command-line program that takes a wordle word (5 letter word) and searches for its validity in a pre-existing file containing valid wordle words. It uses only 5 letter words which is the convention for the wordle game, and can be used to validate wordle input in addition to the game.
